  <div class="w3-padding">
    <p>Hey, I’m Robertson! I’m an IT professional with a solid background in systems administration and a growing passion for cybersecurity. I really enjoy digging into how things work behind the scenes, whether that’s managing file transfer systems, improving infrastructure, or learning how to better secure complex environments.</p>

    <p>Outside of my day job, I like to take on side projects (a few of which are listed below) to explore new tools, technologies, and ideas. These projects are how I stay sharp, keep learning, and have a bit of fun with tech on my own terms. I'm also conintuosly trying to improve my knowledge and skills in the field and am currently studying to take the Comptia Security+ certifaction test.</p>

    <p>When i’m not in front of a screen, you’ll probably find me out riding my motorcycle, playing a few rounds of pickleball, or reading some fiction novels (Im currently on a Brandon Sanderson Kick).</p>

    <p>This site is a space for me to share what I’m working on, what I’m learning, and the kinds of challenges I enjoy tackling. Thanks for stopping by! </p>

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Projects</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>These projects are a key part of how I keep my IT and cybersecurity skills sharp while having fun experimenting with technologies that interest me. Whether it’s building home lab setups, automating tasks, or exploring security tools, each project gives me hands on experience and a chance to learn something new. I believe that practical, self driven work is one of the best ways to grow in this fast-moving field and sharing these projects here lets me track my progress and connect with others who share similar passions.</p>
    <div class="w3-padding">
    <h3 style="font-size: larger;"><b>Personal Website</b></h3>
    <p>
      Building this website from scratch using HTML and CSS was a great hands on experience that helped reinforce some foundational web development concepts. By starting without a framework or template, I gained a much better understanding of how websites are structured, how styling works at a granular level, and how small changes in code can impact layout and usability.
      <br><br>
      Version controlling the project with Git and hosting it through GitHub Pages gave me practical experience with managing a codebase in a clean, trackable way, something that’s just as important for personal projects as it is in team environments. It also helped me get more comfortable with pushing updates, resolving merge issues, and keeping my work organized over time.
      <br><br>
      Most importantly, this project showed me how valuable it is to learn by doing. Creating and maintaining a site end to end from writing the code to deploying it, gave me a full picture of the development process and a better appreciation for the details that go into making something both functional and presentable.
    </p>
    </div>  

    <div class="w3-padding">
    <h3 style="font-size: larger;"><b>Pi-Hole DNS Routing</b></h3>
    <p>
      One of my favorite home lab projects involved setting up Pi-hole, a network wide DNS sinkhole that blocks ads and trackers at the DNS level. By routing all DNS requests on my personal network through a Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole, I was able to effectively block most advertisements, tracking domains, and unwanted content across all devices, without needing to install browser extensions or modify individual settings.
      <br><br>
      This project taught me how DNS resolution works under the hood and gave me hands on experience with configuring custom DNS routing, managing blacklists and whitelists, and monitoring network traffic in real time. I also set up DHCP fallback and configured static IPs to ensure reliable operation.
      <br><br>
      Beyond the technical learning, the result was a noticeable improvement in browsing speed, reduced data usage, and a much cleaner experience across all devices on my network including phones, smart TVs, and IoT devices.
    </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="w3-padding">
    <h3 style="font-size: larger;"><b>Homelab Setup</b></h3>
    <p>
      My homelab is built on an old refurbished PC that I repurposed to run Proxmox, giving me a flexible and powerful virtualization environment without breaking the bank. It currently hosts several key services, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Plex for media streaming across my devices</li>
        <li>Home Assistant for smart home automation and monitoring</li>
        <li>Bitwarden for password management</li>
      </ul>
      This setup is more than just a home entertainment and automation hub, it’s my personal playground for learning and tinkering with new technologies. By managing virtualization, networking, and service integration firsthand, I’m able to deepen my understanding of IT infrastructure, troubleshoot real world scenarios, and stay curious about emerging tools and techniques. It’s a hands on way to build skills that I can apply in professional environments while keeping older hardware useful and out of the landfill.
    </p>
    </div> 

    <div class="w3-padding">
    <h3 style="font-size: larger;"><b>OMARCHY - Main Operating System</b></h3>
    <p>
      This is less of a project, but more of an experiment to see how usable linux can be as a main desktop operating system in todays age as a way to step away from some of the unwanted features, and privacy concerns that come with other modern operating systems.
      <br><br>
      I use Omarchy, a desktop environment based on Arch Linux, as my primary operating system to gain deeper, hands on experience with Linux and its core components. Omarchy provides several key benefits, including full access to the Arch User Repository (AUR), giving me a vast collection of software packages at my fingertips. It’s free from telemetry tracking software, ensuring greater privacy and control over my system.
      <br><br>
      What I love most about Omarchy is how infinitely customizable it is, allowing me to tailor every aspect of my environment to fit my workflow and preferences. Best of all, it’s completely open source, supporting a community driven approach to software development. Using Omarchy challenges me to learn, troubleshoot, and experiment with Linux in a meaningful way, helping me build practical skills that go well beyond the surface.
